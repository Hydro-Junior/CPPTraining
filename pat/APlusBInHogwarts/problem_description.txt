题目描述
If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough."  Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of "Galleon.Sickle.Knut" (Galleon is an integer in [0, 107], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).

输入描述:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.


输出描述:
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.
