题目描述
If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as 0.123*105 with simple chopping.  Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.

输入描述:
Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers N, A and B, where N (<100) is the number of significant digits, and A and B are the two float numbers to be compared.  Each float number is non-negative, no greater than 10100, and that its total digit number is less than 100.


输出描述:
For each test case, print in a line "YES" if the two numbers are treated equal, and then the number in the standard form "0.d1...dN*10^k" (d1>0 unless the number is 0); or "NO" if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form.  All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.
Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.
