题目描述
Given three integers A, B and C in [-263, 263), you are supposed to tell whether A+B > C.

输入描述:
The first line of the input gives the positive number of test cases, T (<=1000).  Then T test cases follow, each consists of a single line containing three integers A, B and C, separated by single spaces.


输出描述:
For each test case, output in one line "Case #X: true" if A+B>C, or "Case #X: false" otherwise, where X is the case number (starting from 1).
