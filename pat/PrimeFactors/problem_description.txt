题目描述
Given any positive integer N, you are supposed to find all of its prime factors, and write them in the format N = p1^k1 * p2^k2 *...*pm^km.

输入描述:
Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer N in the range of long int.


输出描述:
Factor N in the format N = p1^k1 * p2^k2 *...*pm^km, where pi's are prime factors of N in increasing order, and the exponent ki is the number of pi -- hence when there is only one pi, ki is 1 and must NOT be printed out.

输入例子:
97532468

输出例子:
97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291
